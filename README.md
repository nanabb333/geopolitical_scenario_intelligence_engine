# Geopolitical Intelligence Analyst Copilot

A portfolio-ready analyst workflow copilot for geopolitical scenario intake, event classification, historical analog retrieval, market-reaction context, and Markdown memo generation.

This repository converts a user-described geopolitical event into a deterministic historical analog analysis using a local event-study database. It is designed as a research-to-intelligence workflow automation layer, not a forecasting system or investment tool.

## Product Vision

Geopolitical risk analysis should be grounded in historically comparable events before it is turned into executive decision support. This copilot takes a user question, classifies the event, retrieves similar historical analogs, summarizes observed market reactions from the event-study database, and produces a conservative executive brief.

## What The System Does

```text
User question
  -> Event classification
  -> Historical analog retrieval
  -> Market reaction comparison
  -> Scenario pathways
  -> Executive brief
```

The workflow produces:

1. User Event Description
2. Event Classification
3. Most Similar Historical Events
4. Historical Market Reactions
5. Potential Future Pathways
6. Key Risks and Uncertainties
7. Executive Brief

## What The System Does Not Do

- No live news retrieval
- No external APIs
- No LLM calls
- No forecasting
- No return predictions
- No probability estimates
- No trading signals
- No investment recommendations

Similarity scores are deterministic retrieval scores only. They are not probabilities.

## Quick Start

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python3 src/run_scenario.py \
  --query "US announces a new semiconductor subsidy package." \
  --top-k 5 \
  --output results/semiconductor_subsidy_brief.md
```

The command writes a Markdown brief and also prints it to stdout.

## Example User Query

```text
US announces a new semiconductor subsidy package.
```

Example output summary:

```text
Classification: support / subsidy_award / semiconductors
Analog retrieval: CHIPS Act and semiconductor state-support events
Market reaction comparison: observed event-study windows from local CSV data
Pathways: state support, reallocation, anticipation, and implementation uncertainty
Brief type: historical analog decision-support memo
```

Additional curated examples are available in `examples/`.

- [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)

## Core Scripts

- `src/run_scenario.py`: main orchestration CLI
- `src/classify_event.py`: deterministic rule-based event classification
- `src/retrieve_analogs.py`: weighted historical analog retrieval
- `src/compare_market_reactions.py`: observed event-study reaction summaries
- `src/generate_pathways.py`: deterministic qualitative scenario pathways
- `src/generate_brief.py`: Markdown executive brief generation

Existing scripts remain directly runnable for inspection and debugging.

## Inputs

- `data/events.csv`: coded geopolitical event database
- `data/event_firm_returns.csv`: event-level firm return outcomes and abnormal return windows
- `data/sample_user_queries.csv`: example user questions for local testing

## Relationship to Flagship System

Opportunity Under Geopolitical Competition
= flagship evidence-intelligence system

Geopolitical Intelligence Analyst Copilot
= workflow automation layer

The flagship system contains the broader evidence base and geopolitical competition framing. This copilot focuses on analyst productivity: scenario intake, classification, retrieval, and memo generation.

## Portfolio Positioning

Geopolitical Intelligence Analyst Copilot demonstrates how research assets and event-study outputs can be converted into an auditable deterministic analyst workflow copilot for executive risk analysis.

For Business Analytics and Strategy Analytics, it demonstrates structured intake-to-memo automation, repeatable decision-support outputs, and clear user workflow design.

For Risk Analytics and Geopolitical Intelligence, it demonstrates transparent event classification, historical analog retrieval, market-reaction context, and explicit safety boundaries.

For AI workflow automation roles, it demonstrates where deterministic automation can create analyst leverage without relying on external APIs, LLM calls, or opaque prediction claims.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Product analytics architecture
- Geopolitical risk intelligence design
- Business, risk, and strategy analytics positioning
- Analyst productivity workflow automation
- Historical analog retrieval
- Event classification
- Event-study interpretation
- Executive brief generation
- Responsible AI/product safety boundaries
- Standard-library Python implementation
- Reproducible local workflow design

## Validation

```bash
python3 -m compileall src
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

## Safety Boundary

The generated brief supports research and strategic analysis only. It must not be used as a forecast, return prediction, trading signal, or investment recommendation.
